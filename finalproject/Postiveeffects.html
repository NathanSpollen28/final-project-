				<p  class="inter-regular">All information has been sorced from the WHO. The leading body on the topict of good health and wellbeing. It is the objective of this group to spread the message and inform people of the good effects of this specific topic, that lies close to our hearts. It has been a pleasure to bring this to you.</p>

				<p  class="inter-regular"> Well-being is a positive state experienced by individuals and societies. Similar to health, it is a resource for daily life and is determined by social, economic and environmental conditions. Well-being encompasses quality of life and the ability of people and societies to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and purpose. Focusing on well-being supports the tracking of the equitable distribution of resources, overall thriving and sustainability. A society’s well-being can be determined by the extent to which it is resilient, builds capacity for action, and is prepared to transcend challenges (Glossary of Terms 2021).  

WHO works with Member States and partners to advance well-being as it pertains to global health and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Well-being is a major underlying driver of policy coherence across sectors and encourages galvanized action. Advancing societal well-being helps create active, resilient and sustainable communities at local, national and global levels, enabling them to respond to current and emerging health threats such as COVID-19 and environmental disasters.</p>

				<p  class="inter-regular"> LWHO and UNESCO have launched a new initiative “Making Every School a Health Promoting School” through the development and promotion of Global Standards for Health Promoting Schools. The initiative will serve over 2.3 billion school-age children and contribute to the WHO's 13th General Programme of Work target of achieving “1 billion lives made healthier” by 2023.

Globally, over 90% of children in the primary school age, and over 80% of children in the lower secondary school age are enrolled in school, where they spend one third of their time. Schools are a unique setting for creating health and cover an important time period for establishing healthy behaviours. However, challenges remain: global mortality and morbidity estimates suggest that school age children significantly lack health promotion, prevention and health care services.

Health Promoting Schools have been recognized as a strategic vehicle to promote positive development and health. The development of Global Standards for Health Promoting Schools will serve a common framework for both the health and education sectors to accelerate global progress and implement Health Promoting Schools in countries. </p>
